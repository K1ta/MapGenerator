# MapGenerator
Program for creating simple dungeons<br>
The output file is an array of boolean, where <b>true</b> equals "you can go here", <b>false</b> - "you can't"<br>
The main problem now is that there is only one way through the dungeon. I am working on creating more different ways and dead ends
